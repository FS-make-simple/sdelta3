sd3 is a wrapper for sdelta3 that handles compression and 
decompression of tarballs and patches automatically and transparently.

To generate a patch:  $ sd3  old_file  new_file    >  patch_file
To apply    a patch:  $ sd3  old_file  patch_file  >  new_file

sd3 automatically detects the extentions:
.tar.7z     .tar.bz2    .tar.gz     .tar
                .tgz
.sd3.7z     .sd3.bz2    .sd3.gz     .sd3

Therefore, each parameter passed to sd3
should have one of the extentions listed above.

sd3 has the following requirements:
openssl, bash >= 3.0, file >= 4.10, 7za, bzip2, gzip and sdelta3.
Programs must be installed and within the PATH.

The following is an example for creating, 
transferring and applying a sdelta3 patch file.

The source      box has files:  gcc-3.4.1.tar.bz2 and  gcc-3.4.3.tar.bz2
The destination box has only:   gcc-3.4.1.tar.bz2

First, create a sdelta3 patch file.

$ sd3  gcc-3.4.1.tar.bz2  gcc-3.4.3.tar.bz2  gcc-3.4.1-gcc-3.4.3.sd3.7z

Next, send gcc-3.4.1-gcc-3.4.3.sd.7z to the destination box.
Finally, run sd3 to apply the patch and generate the desired file.

$ sd3  gcc-3.4.1.tar.bz2  gcc-3.4.1-gcc-3.4.3.sd3.7z  gcc-3.4.3.tar

Now the destination box has gcc-3.4.3.tar
Did you want it automatically bzip2 compressed?
Then issue:

$ sd3  gcc-3.4.1.tar.bz2  gcc-3.4.1-gcc-3.4.3.sd3.7z  gcc-3.4.3.tar.bz2

Filename extentions can be matched automatically.
The first two file parameters may be complete or partial filenames.
"gcc-3.4.3.tar.bz2"
"gcc-3.4.3.tar"
"gcc-3.4.3"
All three file names above can all be used to 
indicate the same file even when that file is actually: gcc-3.4.3.tar.gz
However gcc-3.4 will not match gcc-3.4.3

The third file name must be complete with extention.
The extention determines what files is created and
what it is compressed with if it is to be compressed.
Files ending with .7z .bz2 or .gz extentions are
compressed with the  appropriate compression program.
Files ending with .sd3 or .tar will not be compressed.
There is no guessing about what to call the third filename.
