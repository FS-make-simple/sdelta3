sdelta3 inherits from   Kyle Sallee's                          sdelta.
sdelta3 was inspired by John Whitney's                         bdelta.
sdelta  was inspired by Joshua MacDonald's                     xdelta.
xdelta  was inspired by Andrew Tridgell's and Paul Mackerras's rsync.

Original sdelta3 source code and endian code by Kyle Sallee.
Additional endian/architecture/POSIX porting code was added
by Pavel Gorshkov <gorshkov.pavel@gmail.com> so that sdelta3
can run on FreeBSD and Solaris platforms.
