sd3 now passes environment variable $CSWIT
as a command line parameter to compression
programs when compressing tarballs.

Added additional parameters for 7za to compress smaller.

Improved make_to().
Various cosmetic changes, mostly printf => fprintf(stderr
Fixes for compilation warnings.

Removed the support for libmd (FreeBSD-only).

Fixes for compilation warnings.
Turned off some slowing debugging counters.
Modified default optimization from -O3 to -Os
because it causes much faster patch generation
by conserving memory.

Berlios squeezed out the PPR by enforcing their 99M file system quota.
The PPR now runs at http://ppr.aakin.net
This release updates the client for the new server location.


Mon Jun 27 22:47:34 UTC 2005    20050627    Kyle Sallee

A new verion of file was released that
identifies 7za archives with a different string.
Therefore, sd3 was updated to recgonize both how
the old and new versions of file report 7-zip archives.

sdreq now checks for patches and optimally compressed
source tarballs on both berlios's ftp and http servers.
That way if the http server is down the ftp server can
be checked to see if the desired file is already present.
The PPR now only accepts requests for sd3 patch generation.

The documentation now reflects sdelta3.
Updated the sdreq client and sd3 wrapper.
sd was renamed sd3.
This release should be good for use with
the PPR if I did not bug sd3 or sdreq.
Finally, we can all enjoy the smaller
7za compressed sdelta3 patches.

Cron is still not running at berlios.
Patches generation may take up to 24
hours depending on whether I am
manually running the server.

I implemented minor tuning to blocks.c and sdelta3.c
that overall produces smaller compressed patches.
Pavel Gorshkov added support for both gnutls 1.2.x and 1.0.x
I modified the Makefiles to automatically compile and
link sdelta3 with available libraries that it requires.
Few modifications are left before sdelta3 is released.
sdreq should be modified to automatically request and
download 7za compressed sdelta3 patches.

Unfortunately, patch production has been offline
for at least 4 days if not more because berlios.de
has neglected starting cron.
Patch production is dependent on cron
running and their http server working.
Neither have been dependable recently.
Anyone know a good home for the PPR?

This release introduces sdelta3.
sdelta3 produces smaller compressed
patches than sdelta and sdelta2.

sdelta3 is less complex.
sdelta3 does not use hashes nor CRC lists.
Instead it combines the best technologies of
sdelta and sdelta2 while eliminating the dubious overhead.
sdelta3 demonstrates an effective delta generator
can be created using only one sorted arrays of blocks
in addition to the content of the files being compared.
